Pneumonia Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This repository contains code for building and evaluating a CNN model to detect pneumonia in chest X-rays.

Project Overview
The code leverages TensorFlow and several libraries to:

Load and pre-process chest X-ray images from two classes: pneumonia and normal.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Build a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers and a final softmax layer for classification.
Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
Generate predictions on new images and analyze the results using classification reports and confusion matrices.
Getting Started
Install dependencies: Make sure you have TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-learn installed.
Download data: Replace the path variables in the code with the location of your downloaded chest X-ray dataset. Ensure the dataset has separate folders for pneumonia and normal cases.
Run the code: Execute the provided Python script.
Key Components
load_images function: Loads and pre-processes images from specified folders and labels them accordingly.
Data preparation: Splits data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
CNN model: Builds a convolutional neural network with appropriate layers and activation functions.
Training: Trains the model on the training set using model.fit.
Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance on the testing set using model.evaluate.
Predictions: Generates predictions on new images and analyzes them using classification reports and confusion matrices.
Further Exploration
Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, filters, epochs) to potentially improve accuracy.
Try different data augmentation techniques to increase training data and potentially reduce overfitting.
Explore more advanced CNN architectures like ResNet or VGGNet.
Visualize the learned features from the convolutional layers to understand how the model makes predictions.
